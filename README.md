# AI-DRIVEN-NON-RADIATIVE-MATERNAL-FETAL-MONITORING-FOR-SAFE-PRENATAL-CARE-IN-SUB-SAHARAN-AFRICA
## Project Overview

This project presents a novel, AI-integrated maternal‚Äìfetal monitoring system that uses non-radiative techniques such as radar sensing and signal processing to ensure safe, continuous prenatal surveillance. The system is designed to detect fetal position, heart rate, and movement using low-power non-ionizing signals combined with deep learning models.

## Features

- **Non-Radiative Monitoring**: Utilizes radio-frequency radar for safe fetal monitoring.
- **AI Integration**: Deep learning models for signal classification and anomaly detection.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Low-latency signal acquisition and processing for live feedback.
- **Privacy-Focused Design**: Contactless monitoring without image/video capture.
- **Low-Cost Hardware Prototype**: Integrates with off-the-shelf embedded systems.
- **Mobile Dashboard Support**: Cloud-syncing and patient monitoring interface.
- **Health Alerts**: Early warning system for abnormal fetal movements or vitals.

## System Components

1. **Radar Sensing Module**: For signal acquisition.
2. **Signal Pre-Processing Unit**: Filters noise and extracts features.
3. **Neural Network Engine**: AI model for detection/classification.
4. **Data Logging & Cloud Sync**: For health record storage.
5. **Mobile/Web Dashboard**: For medical staff and caregivers.

## Technologies Used

- Python / MATLAB for AI modeling
